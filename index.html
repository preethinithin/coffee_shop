                <p>Arabica is the most commonly grown coffee bean; it accounts for 60-75% of the worldwide coffee
                    production. This type of coffee beans is very popular due to its complex taste profiles and aromas.

                <img src="./images/robusta-coffee-beans-500x500.jpg">
                <p>Robusta is the second most-produced species of coffee beans. Robusta grows at lower elevations has
                    high
                    levels of caffeine and is disease resistant. Most people drinking Robusta must add cream and sugar
                    due
                    to its inherent harsh taste</p>

                    flavor, pairing floral and fruity notes with a deep smokiness that some describe as woody.</p>

            <div class="col 4">
                <img src="./images/excelsa-1.jpg">
                <p>Excelsa has recently been reclassified as a type of Liberica coffee because it thrives in the same
                    conditions and grows a similarly tall tree. But the actual coffee it produces is vastly different.
